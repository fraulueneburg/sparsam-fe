## Description

In times of recession and a low economy, sparsam is just the app you need to keep track of your expenses. Instead of having too little money at the end of each month, it calculates your weekly budget, so you can keep track of your frugal or luxurious lifestyle more easily.

Created by leading experts in the industry (read: two formerly broke students), sparsam is here to change your life! Or at least you finances. And there‚Äôs gifs of cute animals, too.

## Features

- üíª automatically calculates your weekly budget based on your monthly earnings and expenses
- üóíÔ∏è lets you define custom spending categories
- ü§ì weekly and monthly view of your budget
- üç∞ beautiful charts of your monthly expenses
- üòª awesome memes for edge cases
